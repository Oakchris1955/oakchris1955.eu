Welcome to my website.\
\
I am Oakchris1955 and I am a teen programmer who likes coding for fun. For more info about me, check my [about page](/about).

### What is this?

This is just my small experiment space on the Internet. I have never actually set up a proper personal site with a domain, so I thought I should give it a try.
\
Apart from that, I also thought it would be fun if I challenged myself to make a website without using a JS framework.

### Why?

I've been writing small one-off projects using HTML and JS frameworks for quite some time. In fact, HTML was one of the first computer languages I learned, alongside CSS and JS. Yet, I never actually had a proper website about **myself**. [I tried to make my own site in the past](https://github.com/Oakchris1955/oakchris1955.github.io), but I never actually made anything worth deploying to it's own domain.

The goal of this site is to serve as a small personal blog, a space where I can document my code adventures and where I can experiment as much as I want at the same time
