Welcome to my website.\

I am Oakchris1955 and I am a teen programmer who likes coding for fun. For more info about me, check my [about page](/about).

### What is this?

This is just my small experiment space on the Internet. I have never actually set up a proper personal site with a domain, so I thought I should give it a try.

Apart from that, I also thought it would be fun if I challenged myself to make a website without using a JS framework.

### Why?
