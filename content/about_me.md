It seems like you've made it to the `about me` page.
Here's some info about myself:

<img srcset="/imgs/avatar.png 2x" alt="Avatar"/>

I am a teen boy from Greece that first discovered programming during the COVID-19 pandemic. You can find more info about my coding passion on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/Oakchris1955/).

When I am not coding on my computer, I usually watch videos, read [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/) or [the European Edition of The Politico](https://www.politico.eu/), and I sometimes play video games (I am a big fan of [Valve's games](https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/valve/) and Westwood Studio's [Command & Conquer series](https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/CandC))

Apart from coding and gaming, I also love the summer: Nature outside is thriving, there's good weather all the time, etc, etc, (also, climate change is a thing, so we have to adapt anyways I guess).

When it comes to political views, I identify as a progressivist and I am a strong advocate of a European Federation.
